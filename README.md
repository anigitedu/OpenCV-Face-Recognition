# OpenCV-Face-Recognition-
FACE DETECTION USING HAAR CASCADES
Face recognition is one of the many wonders that AI research has brought forward to the
world. It is a subject of curiosity for many techies — who would like to have a basic
understanding of how things work. Let us take a dip into the subject, to see how things
work.
❖ Most images of human have similar characteristics. Yet, faces are different from each
other. At the same time, face of the same person changes with emotion, expression, age. In
fact just change in orientation creates a different image.
❖ Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate or visualize
human faces in digital images.
❖ This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with
detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class in digital images and videos.
❖ With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance
especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.

PRE-REQUISITES
